Suggestions:

Add an index.js File: Since "index.js" is mentioned as the main entry point in package.json, consider adding this file to the repository. This file should contain the primary logic for initializing and running the Electron app.

Expand Scripts in package.json: Add more scripts to package.json for tasks like starting the Electron app, building for production, etc.

Project Structure: As the project grows, consider organizing the codebase into directories like src (for source files), assets (for static assets), and tests (for test files).

Contributing Guidelines: If you plan to have collaborators or open-source contributions, consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md file to guide contributors on how to set up their development environment, coding standards, and the process for submitting pull requests.

License: The package.json mentions an "ISC" license, but there's no LICENSE file in the repository. Consider adding a LICENSE file that clearly states the terms under which the software can be used.

Issues & Roadmap: Utilize the GitHub "Issues" feature to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs. This can serve as a roadmap and help in prioritizing development tasks.
